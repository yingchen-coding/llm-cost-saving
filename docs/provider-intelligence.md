# Provider Intelligence

modelbroker should not route only from static provider names. Frontier model quality changes when a
lab shifts research direction, releases a new model, changes quota policy, or proves a capability in
real workloads. Public news can be useful, but only after it is converted into technical routing
signals.

## Signal: Frontier Lab Research Depth

Example signal:

> A frontier lab hires or highlights a senior theoretical-algorithm researcher.

Do not treat this as celebrity or hiring news. The useful technical interpretation is:

- the provider may be investing in deeper reasoning, search, optimization, or agent planning;
- benchmark claims for that provider should be tracked separately from coding-CLI reliability;
- routing policy should not auto-promote the provider until local evals confirm the relevant task
  class improved;
- cost optimization should keep high-reasoning tasks distinct from mechanical work, because a
  technically stronger model is only worth the premium where it actually wins.

## How to Use This in Routing

When a provider strategy signal appears:

1. Add or update a model evidence record with the source and claimed capability.
2. Require a local verification command before enabling auto-route.
3. Map the signal to a task class, such as `reasoning`, `architecture`, `coding`, `review`,
   `agent-planning`, or `tool-use`.
4. Keep cost policy separate: a provider can be technically stronger while still being wrong for
   mechanical tasks like search, scan, summarization, boilerplate, or counting.

The routing decision should be evidence-based:

```text
public signal -> model evidence record -> local eval -> task-specific routing policy
```

No public article should directly change the active route order by itself.
